Hi, I'm Amur Ghose. I'm presently building a new startup, currently under stealth, on the intersection of GenAI x EdTech and am on leave from my ML PhD at UCSD.   


Previously, I wrote software for the past three years (2020 to 2023) at Huawei, Montreal. Earlier yet, in 2018, I received the David Cheriton fellowship for fully funding my MS studies at UWaterloo from 2018 to 2020 where I was a Math + CS Master's student. Before that, I graduated summa cum laude with a Btech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Kanpur in 2018. During IITK, I received the Academic excellence award holder at IITK, awarded to top 7% by GPA. Throughout my undergraduate years, I had a parallel position at Worldquant LLC / Millennium Investments where I implemented efficient software systems for trading.

And a long time ago in a place far, far...(very far) away, I was a high school student in India, where I took the IIT-JEE, scoring roughly at 99.95th percentile, qualified competitive country-wide Indian merit scholarship exams like KVPY, national olympiads in astronomy (INAO, top 30 annually nation-wide), linguistics (top 50 annually nation-wide) and distinctions for the ones in math (INMO, top 100) and physics (INPhO, top 100). 

Unfortunately, I have constant troubles with my LinkedIn page due to duplication issues, please refer [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bS4Q1mYAAAAJ&hl=en) for (some) past publications.
