Hi, I'm Amur Ghose. I'm presently a ML PhD student at UCSD working on a start-up idea.

Previously and in that order, I worked as a researcher at Huawei Montreal till Feb 23, was a Math master's student specializing in CS at UWaterloo, and an Electrical Engineering undergrad at IIT Kanpur. I received the David Cheriton fellowship fully funding my MS studies and was an Academic excellence award holder at IITK, awarded to top 7% by GPA. I worked with Worldquant LLC / Millennium Investments during my undergraduate years. 

During this time, I wrote quite a bit of trading strategies in Python and learnt a thing or two about a thing or two for SWEs. I have published some [stuff](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bS4Q1mYAAAAJ&hl=en) at ML confs like Neurips, EMNLP, UAI, AISTATS etc. 

A long time ago in a country far, far...(very far) away, I was a high school student in India, where I took the IIT-JEE, scoring roughly at 99.95th percentile, qualified some other exams like KVPY, national olympiads in astronomy, linguistics (top 50 or so nationally for each) and distinctions for the ones in math and physics. (top 100), which serve as the pathway to the international teams for India at the olympiads.
