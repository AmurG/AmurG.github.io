# Welcome !

Hi, I'm Amur Ghose. I'm presently a ML PhD student at UCSD working on a start-up idea.

Previously and in that order, I worked as a researcher at Huawei Montreal till Feb 23, was a Math master's student specializing in CS at UWaterloo, and an Electrical Engineering undergrad at IIT Kanpur. I received the David Cheriton fellowship fully funding my MS studies and was an Academic excellence award holder at IITK, awarded to top 7% by GPA. I worked with Worldquant LLC / Millennium Investments.

And, of course, long time ago in a country far, far...(very far) away, I was a high school student in India, where I took the IIT-JEE, qualified some other exams like KVPY, national olympiads in astronomy, linguistics and distinctions for the ones in math and physics.
